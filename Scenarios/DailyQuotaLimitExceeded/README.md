The Daily Quota Limit is used to limit the amount of data for Consumption and Elastic Premium function apps. Once the limit is reached the app is disabled, and you will see the Azure Functions Runtime is unreachable. 

Once the ARM template is deployed, you can use a tool like [apache-jmeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/) to hit the daily limit easily. 

The resolution is to either wait until the next business day or increase the daily limit
